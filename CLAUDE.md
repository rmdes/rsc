# Textcaster — project conventions

## Documentation layout

All generated markdown lives under `docs/superpowers/`, by kind:

- `specs/` — design documents
- `plans/` — implementation plans
- `reviews/` — code-review findings, improvement suggestions, audits
- `documentation/` — operator/user docs (RUNNING.md, …)

Dated documents are named `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`. Don't create markdown at
the repo root or directly in `docs/` — `README.md` is the only exception.
Executed plans/specs are historical records: don't rewrite paths inside them
when files move; update live references (README, newer specs) instead.
