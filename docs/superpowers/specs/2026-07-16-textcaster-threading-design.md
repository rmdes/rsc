# Textcaster — reply threading & conversations design

Date: 2026-07-16
Status: design approved (brainstorm); spec pending review
Author: Ricardo (rmdes) with Claude Code
Basis: `2026-07-15-textcaster-design.md` deferred item 3 ("Reply threading and
conversations"); Textcasting source namespace (source.scripting.com), whose
`source:inReplyTo` (added 5/16/2026) is this milestone's native wire form.

## What this milestone adds

Replies as first-class posts in the one timeline, a conversation (thread)
page, and reply metadata that survives the feed substrate in both directions
— RSS 2.0 out/in (source namespace + Atom Threading), mf2/h-entry in, JSON
Feed out/in via extension — so a future Webmention milestone bolts on
without a migration.

Decisions taken at brainstorm:

- **Replies live in the timeline** like any post, marked, with a thread page
  (`/post/<id>`) grouping the conversation flat, oldest-first. The firehose
  hides nothing; no bumping, no counts.
- **Reply targets are timeline posts** (local or remote) via a reply button.
  No freeform reply-to-URL composer until Webmention-out makes it useful.
  Ingested remote replies may point at URLs we don't hold — those render as
  "in reply to ↗" external links with no thread page.
- **The wire identity of a reply target is the target's `url` ?? `guid`**,
  matched against either on resolution. No public per-post page URLs are
  minted for this; a local post's feed guid is already stable and unique.
- **Conversation grouping is a stored `thread_root_id` plus adoption**
  (approach C): O(1) thread reads, no recursion anywhere (adapter-neutral —
  no SQL-specific CTEs), and out-of-order feed arrival heals.

## Data model — migration 5

Append-only, as ever:

```sql
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN in_reply_to TEXT;         -- wire ref of the target (url ?? guid), null = not a reply
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN in_reply_to_post_id TEXT; -- RESOLVED parent post id; null = orphan (or not a reply)
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN thread_root_id TEXT;      -- root post id when I'm a DESCENDANT; null for roots and non-replies
CREATE INDEX posts_thread_idx ON posts (thread_root_id);
CREATE INDEX posts_reply_to_idx ON posts (in_reply_to);
CREATE INDEX posts_parent_idx ON posts (in_reply_to_post_id);
```

**Resolve once, key on the id (H2).** Ref matching happens exactly once per
reply — at insert (or adoption) — and stores `in_reply_to_post_id`. The
comments feed, the `count` attribute, and the thread derivation all key on
the resolved id, never by re-matching refs at render time. A ref collision
visible at resolution time therefore at worst leaves a reply UNRESOLVED
(honest orphan) — no mis-thread, mis-count, or wrong comments feed. The one
exception is temporal (see the named residual below the rule).

**Ref-resolution rule (pinned):** given wire ref R —
1. posts with `url = R`: match ONLY if exactly one exists — two followed
   feeds syndicating the same article each ingest a row claiming that
   permalink, and a duplicated url must resolve to NOTHING (honest orphan),
   not an arbitrary row. Same guard as the guid arm, for the same reason.
2. else posts with `guid = R`: match ONLY if exactly one exists — `guid` is
   unique per `(author_id, guid)` only, and real feed guids collide;
3. else unresolved: `in_reply_to` kept, both id columns null.

**Named residual (accepted, no machinery):** the exactly-one checks run at
resolution/adoption time and cannot see FUTURE collisions. An orphan
referencing ref X, adopted by the first post carrying X, stays attached to
it even if a second post carrying X arrives later (re-adoption is refused —
now ambiguous — but there is no re-orphaning). Narrow by construction
(guid-only or syndicated-url refs AND orphan-before-both-holders arrival
order); re-orphaning machinery is not worth its weight. So the honest
guarantee is: **a reply never mis-threads at resolution time; a temporal
collision can leave one attached to the first claimant.**

Semantics:

- A non-reply post: both null. No backfill.
- A reply whose target resolves to a known post P:
  `thread_root_id = P.thread_root_id ?? P.id`.
- A reply whose target does NOT resolve (orphan): `in_reply_to` set,
  `thread_root_id` null — it is its own root until adopted. Replies TO an
  orphan root at the orphan (`P.thread_root_id ?? P.id` covers this).
- **Adoption:** when any post P arrives (insert time, local or ingested),
  orphans whose `in_reply_to` matches P under the ref-resolution rule are
  adopted. Both arms honor the ambiguity rule: adopt via `in_reply_to =
  P.url` (or `= P.guid`) only when no OTHER post carries that url (guid) —
  one existence check per arm before the update.
  1. one adopt UPDATE: set `in_reply_to_post_id = P.id` and
     `thread_root_id = <P.thread_root_id ?? P.id>` on the matching orphans;
  2. then **one re-root UPDATE per adopted orphan O** (a loop — several
     orphans can point at P): `UPDATE posts SET thread_root_id = <new root>
     WHERE thread_root_id = O.id` — this single sweep catches O's whole
     subtree because `thread_root_id` always points at the TOP root by
     construction, never an intermediate node. No recursion.
  Runs on every insert; a no-op for posts nothing points at.

Thread read: `getThread(rootId)` = `WHERE id = rootId OR thread_root_id =
rootId ORDER BY published_at ASC, id ASC`.

## Repository additions (contract-tested)

```ts
findPostByRef(ref: string): Promise<Post | undefined>   // the pinned rule: url wins; guid only when globally unique; else undefined
getThread(rootId: string): Promise<TimelineEntry[]>     // root + descendants, (published_at, id) ASC
adoptOrphans(parent: Post): Promise<void>               // the adopt UPDATE + per-orphan re-root loop above
countRepliesByPostIds(ids: string[]): Promise<Map<string, number>> // GROUP BY in_reply_to_post_id — resolved ids, never refs
listRepliesByPostId(id: string): Promise<Post[]>        // the comments feed's direct children, (published_at, id) ASC
```

Five new methods (`getPost` already exists — `sqlite.ts:152`). `insertPost`
itself is unchanged; the service/ingest layer calls `adoptOrphans` after
each successful insert. `Post` gains `inReplyTo: string | null`,
`inReplyToPostId: string | null`, and `threadRootId: string | null`; the
timeline join surfaces them on `TimelineEntry` (the web marker needs them).

## Service & API

- `POST /posts` accepts optional `inReplyTo: <post id>` (the reply button
  always targets a post we hold). The API resolves the target post before
  calling the service — unknown target id → 404, matching the
  handle-resolution style. The service stores
  `in_reply_to = target.url ?? target.guid`,
  `in_reply_to_post_id = target.id` (local replies are resolved by
  construction — no ref matching), and
  `thread_root_id = target.threadRootId ?? target.id`, then adopts.
- Ingested items: `ParsedItem` gains `inReplyTo: string | null`. `ingestItems`
  resolves via `findPostByRef` (the pinned rule), sets all three fields (id
  columns null when unresolved), adopts after insert.
- `GET /post/:id/thread` (public read) → `{ thread: TimelineEntry[] }` —
  the conversation containing post `:id` (resolve to its root first:
  `threadRootId ?? id`), flat, oldest-first. 404 unknown id.
- Replies flow through the existing bus/SSE untouched — they are posts.

## Wire formats

### RSS 2.0 out — dual-emit, source namespace first-class

Per reply item (probed against installed feedsmith 2.9.6 — it generates
`sourceNs` and `thr` and declares both namespaces):

- `<source:inReplyTo>` — the Textcasting-native form — on every reply item.
  Non-permalink (guid-only) refs carry `isPermaLink="false"` — **probed:
  feedsmith 2.9.6 generates the attribute** (`sourceNs.inReplyTo:
  { value, isPermaLink }`), so no fallback tier is needed.
- `<thr:in-reply-to ref="<ref>" href="<ref when URL>">` — always (RFC 4685,
  the WordPress/Atom lineage; `ref` carries non-permalink ids natively).
- `<source:comments count="<n>" feedUrl="<PUBLIC_URL>/post/<id>/comments.xml"/>`
  on every item that has replies (modeled on rss.chat's
  `feedItem.comments = { count, feedUrl }`, `rssnetwork.js` buildFeedItems).
  feedsmith 2.9.6 cannot serialize this element (probed — silently dropped),
  so it is **injected post-generation**: we generated the XML ourselves, so a
  deterministic guid-keyed insertion before the matching `</item>` is safe
  (~10 lines, unit-pinned against feedsmith's stable output). `ponytail:`
  injector dies the day feedsmith's `sourceNs` types grow `comments` — swap
  to the native key on that dep bump (ledger trigger updated accordingly).
  Requires `PUBLIC_URL`; without it the element is omitted (same degradation
  rule as OPML export's local outlines).

### Comments feed — the conversation, pulled

`GET /post/:id/comments.xml` — a **plain RSS 2.0 feed** of the post's direct
replies, one item per reply (each with its own `source:inReplyTo` and, when
it has replies, its own `source:comments` — Dave's threadwalker recurses
exactly this way, `examples/threadwalker/walker.js`). Rendered on request
like every other feed — no republish machinery (rss.chat must re-push static
files to S3 on every reply; our counts are simply always current). Channel
title: `Comments on "<post title or excerpt>"`. 404 unknown post. No
`<cloud>`/hub advertisement on comments feeds in v1 — poll-only artifacts.

Repo backing (see §Repository): `countRepliesByPostIds` for the `count`
attributes (one grouped query per rendered feed page) and
`listRepliesByPostId` for the feed body — both keyed on the RESOLVED
`in_reply_to_post_id`, never by re-matching refs (H2).

### JSON Feed — no reply field in v1 (deliberate)

JSON Feed 1.1 has no standard reply field, and the probed reality kills the
extension route: `generateJsonFeed` passes a `_textcaster` key through, but
`parseJsonFeed` DROPS unknown item keys — so the emission would be
write-only, a proprietary key nothing (not even a peer Textcaster instance)
can read back. Cut. RSS is the federation path for threading. Re-add
signal: a consumer that reads it exists, or JSON Feed standardizes a reply
field, or feedsmith retains unknown keys on parse.

### Ingestion — source namespace preferred

`ParsedItem.inReplyTo` sourced per format, first match wins:

1. RSS: `item.sourceNs.inReplyTo.value` (probed: feedsmith parses it), else
   `item.thr.inReplyTos[0].ref ?? .href` (probed).
2. mf2/h-feed: JF2 `in-reply-to` (probed: mf2tojf2 surfaces `u-in-reply-to`
   as a STRING for a single value and an ARRAY for multiple — the mapping
   handles both and takes the first).
3. JSON Feed: none (see above — no readable reply field exists today).

Atom in: feedsmith exposes `thr` on Atom items too (same namespace) — same
mapping applies.

## Web UI

Design-system rules apply; UI tasks invoke `ui-ux-pro-max` first.

- Reply button on every timeline/lens post → the existing composer with the
  hidden target id (plain form POST, no-JS first-class).
- Timeline/lens posts carrying `threadRootId` (or being a thread root that
  the reader arrived at) show a marker linking to `/post/<threadRootId ?? id>`
  ("view conversation"). A reply whose ref never resolved shows
  "in reply to ↗" linking the raw URL when it is one.
- `/post/<id>` — SSR thread page: the conversation flat, oldest-first, with
  the usual live island filtered client-side to `threadRootId` matches
  (same accepted staleness model as the lenses).

## Deferred — tracked, not dropped

- **`source:comments` CONSUMPTION** (following a remote item's
  `source:comments feedUrl` to pull replies from third parties we don't
  follow — thread completion, what threadwalker does). Emission ships THIS
  milestone (§Wire formats); consumption is a poll-scope expansion (fetching
  N extra feeds per poll, caps, SSRF posture) deserving its own design.
- **Injector retirement:** the post-generation `source:comments` injector is
  temporary — on every feedsmith bump, check whether `sourceNs` types grew
  `comments` (parse AND generate); when they do, replace the injector with
  the native key and add parse-side mapping for the consumption milestone.
  Ledgered in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.
- Textcasting alignment batch (out of threading scope): `source:self`,
  compact `source:cloud`, `source:subscriptionList`/`source:blogroll` on our
  OPML surfaces — cheap adoptions for a between-milestones batch.
- Webmention in/out (design item 7) — the stored per-reply target URL is
  exactly what it needs; nothing to migrate.

## Non-goals

Reply-to-arbitrary-URL composing, reply notifications, timeline bumping,
nested rendering, fetching reply context for unresolved refs, comment
moderation, editing threads, push (hub/cloud) on comments feeds.
`source:comments` consumption (above — deferred with a named trigger, not a
non-goal forever; emission IS in scope).

## Testing

- Contract: `findPostByRef` (url and guid match), `getThread` order across
  same-ms ties, adoption incl. an orphan WITH its own descendants (subtree
  re-roots), `getPost`.
- Unit: wire mapping out (dual-emit shapes incl. `isPermaLink="false"` on a
  bare-guid ref) and in (source-preferred order, thr fallback, JF2
  string-vs-array `in-reply-to`).
- Contract: the H2 pins — a guid shared by two posts resolves to NOTHING
  (orphan, not a first-match thread) and is excluded from adoption; a url
  shared by two posts likewise resolves to nothing (Hole A); a unique url
  match beats a guid match; counts/comments key on resolved ids only.
- HTTP: `POST /posts` with `inReplyTo` happy/404; `GET /post/:id/thread`
  content + order + 404.
- Comments feed + injector: `GET /post/:id/comments.xml` items/order/404;
  the injected `<source:comments>` lands inside the RIGHT `</item>` (guid
  keyed), carries correct count + feedUrl, and appears only on items with
  replies; omitted without `PUBLIC_URL`.
- **Money test (definition of done):** two in-process instances. B follows
  A's feed. A local-composes a post; B ingests it. A local user on B replies
  via the reply button; B's feed now carries `source:inReplyTo` +
  `thr:in-reply-to`; A ingests B's feed and A's thread page for the original
  post shows the reply — a conversation federated over plain RSS, round
  trip. Then: A's main feed item for the original post now advertises
  `<source:comments count="1">` whose `feedUrl` serves a comments feed
  containing B's reply — the Winer-native pull side, threadwalker-walkable.
  Sibling: the same flow through the mf2/h-feed path (reply ingested from an
  h-entry with `u-in-reply-to`).
- Web: form-action test for reply compose; thread-page load test; island
  predicate extended for the thread lens.

## Sequencing

1. Migration 5 + repository additions + contract pins.
2. Service/API: reply compose, resolution + adoption, thread endpoint.
3. Wire: feed emit (source + thr + `_textcaster`), the comments feed route +
   `source:comments` injector, and `ParsedItem.inReplyTo` ingestion across
   all three paths (probes first).
4. Web: reply button, markers, thread page + live island.
5. Money test + RUNNING.md.
